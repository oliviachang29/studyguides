## Adding new guides
Don't know how to code? Email me at **hello@studyguides.science** and send me your Google Doc. Make sure you have it formatted (as stated below)!

### Formatting guides

Guides should[look like this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19nukW7pR2KgPvbp1CCWFlNKSGWQ9ll4RSdaApK31mQk/edit?usp=sharing).
11pt Proxima Nova and tables with 0px border.

All new guides go under the _guide folder. The folders (apcs, biology, chemistry) are there only for organization. Jekyll will NOT add categories automatically. Each file needs to be prepended with the following frontmatter:
```
---
title: "Chapter 5: Program Design/Analysis"
categories:
- apcs
layout: guide
link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ulhxlF_GS0I7m-_9bvZ8QgieKfxDFpDcKsZKRcOQI7c/
description: Waterfall model and object-oriented-program design.
---
```
**IMPORTANT!** the "categories" property must **exactly** match the title of the category, as seen in _category, or it won't appear.

#### How to get the link:
Go to File > Publish to Web > Enable. Make sure the Google Doc has link sharing mode enabled (Anyone with the link can VIEW - not edit.)
Use the link from link sharing mode, NOT publish. Remove the edit?usp=sharing at the end.
